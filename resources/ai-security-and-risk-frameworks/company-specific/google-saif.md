## Purpose and Coverage

Google's Secure AI Framework (SAIF) offers a comprehensive guide designed to help organizations build and deploy AI systems securely. The framework provides structured approaches to AI security, addressing critical risks including:

- Data poisoning attempts targeting training datasets 
- Model exfiltration through extraction attacks
- Unauthorized access to training data through inference attacks
- Prompt injection vulnerabilities in generative AI systems

SAIF promotes best practices for secure AI development throughout the lifecycle, helping organizations establish security controls that align with emerging industry standards.

## Strengths

SAIF excels in providing practical guidance for securing AI systems during development and deployment phases. Its structured approach helps teams systematically address common vulnerability classes while promoting security awareness across both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The framework benefits from Google's extensive experience deploying AI systems at scale and reflects lessons learned from real-world implementation challenges.

## Limitations

Despite its comprehensive approach to conventional AI security, SAIF exhibits limitations in addressing the full scope of supply chain concerns. The framework's complexity creates implementation challenges, particularly for smaller organizations without extensive security resources. Additionally, SAIF requires continuous updates to address rapidly evolving threats in the AI ecosystem.

Notable gaps include limited guidance on verifying the integrity of third-party models and insufficient attention to securing the interfaces between components in complex multi-stage pipelines. While data security is addressed, the framework lacks detailed protocols for establishing and maintaining provenance across the complete AI supply chain.
