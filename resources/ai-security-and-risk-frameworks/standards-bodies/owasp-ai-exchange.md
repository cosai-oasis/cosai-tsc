# OWASP AI Exchange

## Documentation

- Official website: https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-exchange/

The OWASP AI Exchange is an open collaborative project that serves as a centralized knowledge base for AI security. It includes several key resources:

- OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/
- OWASP Machine Learning Security Verification Standard (MLSVS): https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-verification-standard/
- OWASP AI Security Testing Guide: https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-testing-guide/

These resources collectively provide guidance on securing AI applications with a particular focus on emerging threats in generative AI and LLMs.

## Purpose and Coverage
The OWASP AI Exchange represents an open collaborative project aimed at fostering the development of security standards and best practices for AI systems. Its Top 10 Generative AI Threats framework focuses specifically on critical security risks affecting Large Language Models and generative AI systems, highlighting concerns including:

- Prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure output handling
- Data and model poisoning
- Sensitive information disclosure
- Supply chain compromises

The framework offers practical mitigations to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities, serving as an accessible security reference for organizations deploying AI solutions.

## Strengths
OWASP's community-driven approach ensures broad input from diverse security practitioners, resulting in practical guidance relevant to current implementation challenges. The framework's focus on generative AI addresses some of the most pressing security concerns emerging with widespread adoption of these technologies.

## Limitations
While acknowledging supply chain risks, the OWASP frameworks lack a comprehensive methodology for securing the complete AI supply chain. They don't provide detailed guidance for implementing provenance tracking systems that would ensure full traceability of datasets, models, and dependencies.

The frameworks also offer limited guidance on validating the integrity and security properties of models and components from third-party sources. As organizations increasingly adopt complex AI pipelines with numerous dependencies, this gap becomes particularly significant for ensuring end-to-end security.
