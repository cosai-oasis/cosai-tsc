# CoSAI Maintainer Policy

## How can you become a maintainer for CoSAI?
CoSAI Workstream Leads serve as maintainers for the repositories dedicated to their workstream. Additional maintainers can be appointed as outlined below. The number of maintainers needed per repository is determined by the CoSAI Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

There are two ways to become a maintainer: You are invited to become a maintainer by a current maintainer, or you make a request to an existing maintainer to become one.

With either path you become a "provisional maintainer". As such you will need to show consistent contributions of code or other work to the project. This can be in the form of pull requests that get merged into master. Or it can be in the form of documentation or related artifacts that guide the development activities of others.

All provisional maintainers must meet the following requirements: 
* Running the project locally
* Using the testing framework
* Explaining the components of the system architecture
* Walking through the existing code and explain it

Once the provisional maintainer demonstrates their capabilities, the existing maintainers will vote during the next scheduled maintainer meeting to give the prospect full maintainer status. A [Simple Majority](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dSimpleMajority) vote is required to add a new maintainer. Voting that results in a tie or potentially other issue will be brought to the TSC for review.

## What do maintainers do?
Maintainers for the CoSAI Open Project are primarily responsible for:
* Contributing code and other work to the project in the form of PRs that are linked to open and prioritized issues
* Reviewing, giving feedback when needed, and merging PRs into the master branch
* Reviewing, cutting, testing, and releasing new versions of CoSAI code or other content
* Working with the TSC and Workstream leads to advance the Open Project

## What is expected of maintainers?
In general, a maintainer needs to:
* be an expert in one or more fields related to the project
* show commitment over time and respond to PRs, issues, bug reports and questions to the mailing list (or on Slack) in a timely manner
* be reliable in completing issues to which they have been assigned
* attend the regular maintainer meetings (with occasional absences allowed)
* follow the project style and testing guidelines
* have a high degree of understanding of the project goals and objectives
* be welcoming to others in the community who are using the project

## How do the maintainers organize?

#### Slack
Maintainers meet and discuss issues virtually via the private #maintainers slack room in the project slack.

#### Meetings (TBC)
There are regular maintainer meetings where members can discuss plans and issues related to the project, updates, release planning, and other related topics. Summaries of these meetings will be posted either in the Slack channel or sent to the members via email. The cadence of this meeting is based on the preference of the workstream leads. 

### How to stop being a maintainer?
Any of the following ways:
* You stop reviewing PR's, responding to messages, answering emails, and/or generally ghost the project for 4 weeks. You will then be removed as a maintainer.
* You notify the other maintainers you would like to relinquish your maintainer status.
* You are disrespectful towards anyone in the community and/or involved in the project and violate [the code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* You are disruptive to the general process of maintaining the project, meetings, discussions, issues, or other.

The majority of all current maintainers constitute a quorum for a meeting involving a question of removal. A simple majority vote from maintainers attending the meeting is required to remove a maintainer, but the TSC may be brought in to arbitrate if the maintainer to be removed or any other maintainer wishes to dispute the action.
