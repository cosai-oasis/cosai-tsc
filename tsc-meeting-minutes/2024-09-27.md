## Summary
This was the launch meeting for the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI) Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Key points discussed:

* Introductions were made by TSC members from various companies listed in CoSAI Technical Steering Committee Roster (Copy - DO NOT EDIT)
* The governance structure and rules for the TSC were explained, including attendance requirements and decision-making processes.

* Three main workstreams were outlined:
  1. Software supply chain security for AI systems
  2. Preparing defenders for the changing AI security landscape
  3. AI governance and risk management
* Each workstream will have at least two leads and involve participants from both TSC member companies and other organizations.
* The focus will be on security aspects rather than safety or broader AI ethics issues.
* A timeline for next steps was provided, including volunteering for workstreams, selecting leads, and having initial workstream meetings by mid-October.
* There was discussion about balancing immediate practical guidance with longer-term strategic work.
* The importance of alignment with other standards efforts was emphasized.
