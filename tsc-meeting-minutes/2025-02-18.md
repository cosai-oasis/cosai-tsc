## Summary 
There was discussion about the scope of the project, particularly around privacy and security. It was clarified that the focus should be on security controls and technical aspects rather than broader privacy or ethical concerns.

* A new workstream (Workstream 4) focused on agentic systems was introduced. Volunteers are being sought to lead and contribute to this workstream.
* Updates were provided on the progress of Workstreams 1, 2 and 3:
  * Workstream 1 is close to completing their first draft and moving into the editing phase.
  * Workstream 2 is making progress on their landscaping paper and has identified 3 focus areas for additional work.
  * Workstream 3 is behind Workstreams 1 and 2 but has a framework in place and is making progress.
* There was discussion about the need for consistency and cross-referencing between the different workstreams' outputs.
* The importance of having engaged and energetic participants for Workstream 4 was emphasized.

## Action Items
* Share updated LLM usage policy language with TSC members for async feedback.
* Develop a standardized onboarding process for new participants joining workstreams.
* Explore options for standardizing graphics/iconography across workstream outputs.
* Coordinate between Workstreams 1 and 2 on threat modeling to ensure consistent approaches.
* Consider ways to incorporate education and outreach elements into Workstream 2's outputs.
* Request a technical editor from the PGB to review and unify outputs across all workstreams.
* TSC to take interim responsibility for ensuring coherence across workstream outputs until a long-term solution is in place.
* Recruit volunteers for Workstream 4, emphasizing the need for highly engaged participants.
