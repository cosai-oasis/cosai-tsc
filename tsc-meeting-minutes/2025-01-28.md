# CoSAI TSC Meeting Minutes -- DRAFT

## Date: 28 January 2025

## Summary

The meeting focused on updates from the different workstreams of the CoSAI project and discussed the use of AI language models to assist with drafting documents:

* Workstream 1 is behind schedule on their landscape paper. They a couple of pages of content but need more time, likely until the end of February. The group discussed ways to accelerate progress, including breaking into smaller working groups.
* Workstream 2 has about 30 pages of content for their landscape paper and expects to have a draft ready in 1-2 weeks. They are also starting work on additional RFCs.
* Workstream 3 is making progress with new co-leads.
* The TSC chairs (JR and Akila) experimented with using AI language models to generate an initial draft for Workstream 3's paper. This sparked a discussion about the appropriate use of AI tools in the CoSAI project.
* The group agreed to share the AI-generated draft with Workstream 3 as input, but emphasized it cannot be the final product.
* There was consensus that AI tools could be helpful for generating initial drafts, doing research, and reviewing content, but human judgment and authorship is still critical.
* The group will seek guidance from OASIS on the legal and policy implications of using AI tools in standards development.
